# Arrays
- *linear* data type
- *indexed* - each element in the array has an index, a number that says where in the array the element is located
- we can imagine an array as a large chunk of memory divided into smaller blocks of memory and each block is capable of storing a data value of sosme type
- values are of the *same data type*
- *fixed size* - after an array is initialized/constructed, it cannot be changed (static memory allocation)
